 * BOOTSTRAP

 * - Every process/task should be a function that returns a promise.
 * Make sure that the server task is always the last one, as it passes the server instance to the
 * resolve method of the bootsrtap promise (see PROCESSES below). Almost all code that should only
 * run once should be presented as a bootstrap process.
